--[[ Midi Suggester - keys, note names, and reading a chord.

     Pure Lua. Nothing in this file touches REAPER or ImGui, so that
     tests/test_theory.lua can run it and check it rather than only read it.

     Three things live here, because everything else leans on all three:

       - Keys: ScaleView for REAPER's eighteen spelled roots and its
         seven-note scales, with notes spelled the way ScaleView spells them.
       - Finding the key of some notes, which ScaleView never had to do.
       - Naming a chord from its notes. That is ScaleView Pro's reader, ported
         unchanged, so a chord is called the same thing in both tools - and so
         the chords this script suggests are named by the same code that names
         the chords it reads.

     Scale degrees are 0-based (0 is the tonic) because the arithmetic wants
     them that way. Table indices are 1-based, like Lua.

--
-- ScaleView's roots and scales, so the tools agree on what a key is and what
-- its notes are called. Both spellings of every black key are here plus Cb,
-- because C# major and Db major are the same seven notes written differently.
--
-- Only the seven-note scales are offered. Chords are built by stacking every
-- other scale note, and a five- or six-note scale has no thirds to stack:
-- a "triad" of the minor pentatonic is a pile of fourths.

-- correlates best with that count wins.
--
-- The profiles cannot tell a key from its relative minor very well - the two

-- it starts on helps. That is how a musician settles it too.

      phrase is five notes, C to G, and correlates best with E minor - which

      asked, both of them things a musician asks:

        - Is every note in the key? Time spent outside the scale counts
          against it. (The raised seventh does not, in minor: the harmonic
          minor's leading tone is part of a minor key.)
        - Does the tune sit on the key's tonic chord? Time spent on its 1, 3
          and 5 counts for it.

      Measured over fifteen tunes and progressions (see the session log),
      every setting of these weights misses one. This one misses Ode to Joy,
      whose first phrase ends on D - a half cadence, which from the melody
      alone is as good as D minor. The setting that gets Ode right misses
      Happy Birthday instead, which ends on its tonic, and a tune ending on
