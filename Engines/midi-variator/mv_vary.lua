--[[ Midi Variator - making a variation of some music.

     Pure Lua: no reaper., no ImGui. The notes arrive as plain tables, in
     quarter notes counted from the bar line at or before the item:

       { pitch = 60, start = 0.0, len = 1.0, vel = 100, chan = 0 }

     with the source around them:

       { notes, lead, beats, barBeats, pulse }

     `lead` is where the item starts (0 when it starts on a bar line) and
     `beats` where it ends, both in the same quarter notes, so the engine's
     bars and beats are the project's.

     The one rule everything here keeps: A VARIATION IS ALWAYS MADE FROM THE
     ORIGINAL. `vary` takes the original and a seed and nothing else, so the
     twentieth variation is exactly as close to the original as the first -
     nothing accumulates. That is the Nordic Noir way with a motif: it keeps
     coming back, a little different each time, never wandering off.

     How small is small:

       - A handful of changes to the notes themselves (`budget`), at most one
         to any one moment of the music, and never more than 30% of it.
       - Each of those is one musical move a player might make: a note nudged
         a step within the key, a note repeated or tied, a beat anticipated,
         a passing note or a grace note added, a note left out, a chord
         revoiced, rolled or coloured.
       - Then, lightly, over everything: timing, velocity and length, the way
         nobody plays a phrase twice exactly alike.

--[[  Changing a chord's quality: one small step to a neighbouring chord.

      The chord is read by ScaleView Pro's chord reader (mv_theory.nameChord),
      which gives its root. Each rule says which intervals above the root
      must be there (`needs`) and must not (`lacks`), and then does one
      thing - or, for the eleventh, two:

        add   a new chord tone (C -> C7, Cmaj7, C6, Cadd9; C7 -> C9, C13, C7b9)
        move  a chord tone a semitone or a tone (sus, minor <-> major,
              Cmin -> Cdim, C -> Caug, Cmin7b5 -> Cdim7)
        drop  a chord tone (C7 -> C)

      Every note a rule would add must be in the scale unless the
      "Chord changes may leave the scale" box is ticked (opts.outside).
      The bass is never moved or dropped, and a dropped note is never the
      top one, so the chord keeps its footing and its outline. ]]

-- changed (Hutchinson, ch. 11; Good Idea's sequence and fragment):
--
--   invert      the tune turned upside down, mirrored in the scale
--   retrograde  the notes in reverse order, in the same rhythm
--   transpose   the stretch moved up or down the scale - a sequence
--   stretch     its intervals widened (steps become thirds)
--   squeeze     its intervals narrowed (leaps become steps)
--   fragment    its first half again, a step lower, in place of the rest
--
-- Everything moves by scale positions, so a moved tune stays in the key.
-- The rhythm stays (but for fragment, which repeats the first half's), so
-- the motif is still recognisable by its rhythm. With chords under a tune,
-- only the tune is inverted, reversed or stretched, and each of its notes
-- is nudged to the nearest scale note that does not grind and stays on
-- top; a sequence moves everything. One change, covering every moment in
