# Noterator

A notation app for the Mac that writes music with you. Most of the music comes
from the family's generators - **Good Idea** first, **Midi Suggester** for
ideas around what you have, **Midi Variator** to change it, and **Starting
Blocks** as a toolbox of chords, arpeggios, runs and intervals - and lands on
the page as real notation you can read, edit, play and export.

## What it does

- **A score you can read.** Staves, clefs, key and time signatures, beams,
  stems, accidentals, ties, triplets and rests are worked out from the notes
  automatically, set in Bravura, the standard music font. Notes that sound
  together line up across every instrument.
- **Generators built in.** Drag across some bars, choose a generator, press
  Generate, click a result to hear it, press Insert: the music fills exactly
  those bars, the tune on top, the bass at the bottom, the chords shared out
  between. The generators are your own engines, unchanged, with every setting
  they have in REAPER.
- **Starting Blocks as a toolbox.** Pick a chord, arpeggio, run or interval;
  every degree of the key is a button. Click one to see and hear it, Insert to
  put it at the caret - then the next one goes after it. (Drum grooves come
  from Good Idea.)
- **Start from an ensemble.** New offers small groups (string quartet, wind
  and brass quintets, choir, band, jazz combo), whole orchestral sections
  (strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion), a chamber or full orchestra, and a
  big band - every instrument with a sound of its own.
- **It knows the instruments.** A violin and a viola get different clefs,
  ranges and registers, and the generators write differently for each. Notes
  an instrument cannot play turn red; notes outside where it sounds best turn
  grey; a chord on a one-line instrument, a run faster than it can play, or a
  leap too wide get a red mark - hover over a note to see why.
- **Chords and scales on the timeline.** Two lanes along the top name the
  chords and the scale as you write. Click a chord to hear it, the scale to
  hear the scale, any note to hear it.
- **Write it yourself.** Click notes onto the staff, type letters (A-G) and
  numbers (note values), or play a MIDI keyboard.
- **Hear it.** Plays through the General MIDI orchestra built into macOS - no
  sounds to install - with AutoCC's swells on strings, wind and brass.
- **Take it with you.** Export the whole score or the selected bars as MIDI
  (with all four AutoCC lanes, for sample libraries), as MusicXML for Dorico,
  Sibelius, MuseScore or Finale, or as WAV audio. Open or drop in a MIDI or
  MusicXML file (.musicxml, .xml, .mxl) to bring one in.
- **Black on white**, or a dark page if you prefer (the **Dark page** button).

## Installing on a Mac

The app is built automatically on GitHub every time the code changes.

1. Open the repository's **Actions** tab on GitHub, click the latest green
   **Build** run, and download **Noterator-macOS** under *Artifacts*. (Once a
   version is tagged, it is also under **Releases**.)
2. Unzip it and open `Noterator-macOS.dmg`. Drag Noterator into Applications.
3. The first time only, **right-click** Noterator in Applications and choose
   **Open**. macOS asks because the app is not yet signed with an Apple
   Developer certificate. If it says the app is "damaged", see
   [docs/INSTALL-MAC.txt](docs/INSTALL-MAC.txt) - it is one line in Terminal.

It needs a Mac with Apple silicon (M1 or later).

## Using it

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Start a score | **New**: a small group, a whole orchestral section, a chamber or full orchestra, or a big band |
| Bring music in | **Open**, or drop a MIDI or MusicXML file (.mid, .musicxml, .xml, .mxl) on the window |
| Put the caret in a part | click the staff, or the part's name |
| Choose bars | click an empty bar; drag across bars and staves for more; drag along the Chords lane for every part; **Esc** lets go |
| Generate | **Generate** tab: choose a generator, **Generate**, click a result to hear it, **Insert** - into the chosen bars, or the caret's part |
| Blocks | **Blocks** tab: choose a kind, click a degree to see and hear it, **Insert** at the caret |
| Write notes | **N** for note input, then click the staff, type **A-G**, or play a MIDI keyboard |
| Note values | **1-7** (5 is a quarter, 6 a half, 4 an eighth), **.** dot, **T** triplet, **0** rest |
| Add to a chord | **Shift** + letter, or Shift-click |
| Select | click a note; **Shift**-drag for several; double-click for a whole chord |
| Change notes | **Up/Down** a semitone, **Cmd+Up/Down** an octave, drag a note up or down, **Delete** |
| Hear | **Space** plays from the selection or the caret; click any note or chord |
| Take it out | **Export**: the score or the chosen bars as MIDI, MusicXML or WAV |
| Light or dark | the page is black on white; **Dark page** turns it round |
| Undo | **Cmd+Z**, **Shift+Cmd+Z** |
| All the keys | **H** |

The **Parts** tab adds and removes instruments, and shows what each one can
do. The **Score** tab sets the title, tempo, time signature and key.

## Where it is going

Next, roughly in order:

- a page view (systems on pages, a title) beside the scrolling galley;
- dynamics, articulations and slurs, and articulation switching for sample libraries;
- CC lanes you can draw on, beside the automatic ones;
- VST3 and CLAP instruments per part, and SoundFonts through the Mac's synth;
- Windows.

## For developers

```sh
# the core and its tests: no JUCE, seconds

# the generators, outside the app

[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is the working guide, [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
the shape of it and every big decision, [docs/decisions](docs/decisions/README.md)
the reasons in full, and [docs/NEXT-SESSION.md](docs/NEXT-SESSION.md) the prompt to
carry on in a new session.
