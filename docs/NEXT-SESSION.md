# Prompt for the next session

Copy everything in the box below into a new Claude Code session on the
Noterator repository. Replace the line under "This session" with what you
want done; if you leave it, the session starts on the first roadmap item.

```text
We're continuing work on Noterator (KallumS/Noterator): a macOS notation app
(JUCE 8, C++17, Apple silicon only) whose music mostly comes from my
generators, which run unchanged inside it through embedded Lua:
- Generate tab: Generate Notes (my Good Idea engine, the main one - motifs,
  phrases, measures and drum grooves), Suggest Notes (Midi Suggester: ideas
  around chords or a tune I have), Vary Notes (Midi Variator: changes music
  already written). In the code they keep their engine names.
- Blocks tab: Starting Blocks as a toolbox of chords, arpeggios, runs and
  intervals on every degree of the key, placed at the caret one after another.
- Bars can be chosen by clicking or dragging over the page, and Generate
  Notes fills them across the chosen instruments.
- New scores start from templates up to a full orchestra and a big band; every
  instrument keeps its own sound through Apple's built-in General MIDI synth.
- Scores open and export as MIDI and MusicXML; audio exports as WAV. The page
  is black on white by default, with a Dark page option.
- Follow: while it plays, the page scrolls smoothly with the music, or turns
  a page at a time (Play menu).
It works; I have tested it on my Mac (Follow not yet).

There is a sister app, Miderator (KallumS/Miderator): this app with a piano
roll instead of notation. It shares this repository's music code byte for
byte (Source/Core except its Roll.*, Source/Engines, the engines, the core
tests), copied across with its tools/sync_from_noterator.sh. A change to the
shared code is made here first; tell me if it should go to Miderator too.

I'm not technical: explain things in plain words, show me screenshots of what
changed, and make sure each change reaches me as the downloadable Mac app from
GitHub Actions.

Before doing anything:
1. If the branch ccr-ac8da7d9-3sbl5x (Follow, decisions 0033 and 0034) is
   not yet merged into main, start your branch from it.
2. Read CLAUDE.md, then docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (every decision on one page),
   then the latest logs in docs/sessions/. Follow their rules - especially:
   never edit the vendored engines in Engines/<app>/ (adapters are fine),
   no JUCE in Source/Core, where a generated result lands is decided only in
   Controller::place, a part's MIDI channel can be above 16 (banks), look at
   a render after any engraving change, and commit and push early.
3. Build and run the tests (core, app tests, tools/try_generators.lua), and
   render the demo page, to confirm everything is green before changing
   anything. For anything in the window, run the app headless under Xvfb and
   look at screenshots; for playback, CLAUDE.md says how to fake a sound
   card so the playhead moves.

This session:
<what I want next - for example: "a page view", "dynamics and articulations",
"drawable CC lanes", "VST3 instruments per part", "save my own templates", or
a list of things I noticed while testing>

The roadmap, in the order I'm most likely to want it: a page view (systems on
pages, title, parts); dynamics, articulations and slurs, with articulation
switching for sample libraries (and carried in MusicXML); drawable CC lanes
seeded by AutoCC; VST3 and CLAP instruments per part and SoundFonts through
the Mac's General MIDI synth; saving my own templates; real-time MIDI
recording; Windows. Known rough edges are in the latest session log's
"Not done yet".

When you finish: write the session log in docs/sessions/ (and its line in
docs/sessions/README.md), add a decision record in docs/decisions/ (with its
line in docs/decisions/README.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for any choice
someone could reasonably make the other way - numbered after the highest in
either Noterator or Miderator - update CLAUDE.md and README.md if what the
app does or a rule changed, rewrite docs/NEXT-SESSION.md, push, check that
the GitHub Actions run is green on both Linux and macOS (the Mac test log
should say it rendered through Apple General MIDI), and tell me where to
download the new app.
```

## Things worth knowing before you paste it

- The other repositories (Good-Idea, Midi-Catalogue, ScaleView and so on) are
  only needed if the session has to copy an engine update across; it will ask
  for them if so. Miderator is needed when a change to the shared music code
  should reach it too.
- If you want the app to open with a normal double-click, the session can set
  up Apple Developer ID signing - it needs your Apple Developer account, added
  to the repository as secrets.
- The latest work (Follow) is on the branch `ccr-ac8da7d9-3sbl5x`. To put it
  on the main branch, ask a session to open a pull request for you to merge.
