# Decisions

One file per decision that would otherwise have to be re-argued from scratch:
what the situation was, what was chosen, and what it costs. They are dated and
numbered and **they are not edited to stay true** - a reversed decision keeps
its text and gains a line at the top pointing at the one that replaced it.

`CLAUDE.md` is the working guide; these are the reasons underneath it. The code
refers to them by number: "(decision 0006)".
