/*
    Engrave - the score in, a laid-out page out.

    Pure: no JUCE and no drawing. Everything here is decided in staff spaces -
    which notes make a chord, how a duration is written, where a beam goes,
    which way a stem turns, which accidental is shown - and returned as values,
    so a test can assert a ledger line or a beam exists. `ScoreRenderer` turns
    the result into glyphs. That split is Starting Blocks Notation's (its
    decision 0003, "split the engraving at a pen") and the rules are mostly
    its, ported and grown from one block on one or two staves to a score of
    many parts:

      - a note is written as its share of the bar where the MIDI was gated
        short of the next note (sb 0005);
      - a duration with a single symbol is written as that symbol wherever it
        falls; only one with no symbol of its own is split;
      - the key signature is scored, not looked up (Spelling.h);
      - stem length is measured from the far head of a chord;
      - a beam leans a quarter of the interval it covers, at most a space and
        a bit;
      - accidentals last to the bar line, carry across a tie, and pack into
        columns;
      - which side of the stem a crossed head goes is decided once, here.

    What is new is that every staff of every part shares one set of columns
    per bar, so notes that sound together line up vertically on the page
    (decision 0004).

    Coordinates: x runs right from the start of the first bar's content, y runs
    down, and each staff's top line is at its own `top`. A staff position is
    counted in half-spaces up from the bottom line: 0 is the bottom line, 8 the
    top line, -2 the first ledger line below.
