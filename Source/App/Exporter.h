    Exporter - a score, or some of its bars, out as a MIDI file or as audio.

    Both read the same performance playback plays (Perform.h). A MIDI file
    carries all four of AutoCC's lanes, for a sample library; audio is
    rendered through the same synth the app plays with, off the audio thread
    and faster than real time.
